Learning Path

Structured learning path to become a data engineer:

 1. Foundational Skills
   - Programming Languages: Start with Python and SQL. These are essential for data manipulation and querying databases.
   - Data Structures and Algorithms: Understanding these concepts is crucial for efficient data processing.
   - Python: Essential for data manipulation and automation.Start with basics and move to advanced topics. Focus on libraries like Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
   - SQL: Crucial for querying and managing relational databases.Learn SQL syntax, queries, joins, subqueries, dynamic queries, stored procedure, trigger and 
     performance tuning.

 2. Database Management
   - SQL Databases: Learn about relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL.
   - NoSQL Databases: Get familiar with databases like MongoDB and Cassandra.

 3. Data Processing
   - Batch Processing: Tools like Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark.
   - Stream Processing: Learn about Apache Kafka and Apache Flink.

 4. Data Warehousing
   - Data Lakes: Understand the concept and tools like Amazon S3.
   - Data Warehouses: Learn about Redshift, BigQuery, and Snowflake.
   - Tools: Familiarity with Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, or Google BigQuery.
   - Concepts: Understanding of data modeling, ETL processes, and data lakes.
   - Snowflake: Understand Snowflake architecture, data loading, querying, and performance optimization.

 5. Cloud Platforms
   - AWS: Services like S3, Redshift, and EMR.
   - Google Cloud: BigQuery, Dataflow, and Pub/Sub.
   - Azure: Azure Data Lake, Azure SQL Data Warehouse.Learn about Azure Data Factory for ETL, Azure Synapse Analytics for data warehousing, and Azure Databricks for 
     big data processing.Azure Data Factory, Azure Synapse Analytics, and Azure Databricks.

 6. Big Data Technologies
   - Hadoop Ecosystem: HDFS, MapReduce, Hive.
   - Spark Ecosystem: PySpark, Spark SQL.
   - PySpark: Learn the basics of Apache Spark and how to use PySpark for big data processing. Focus on Spark SQL and DataFrames.

 7. Data Pipeline Skills
   - ETL Tools: Learn about tools like Apache NiFi, Talend, and Airflow.Get hands-on with tools like Apache Airflow for workflow orchestration and Talend for data integration.
   - Orchestration: Understand how to schedule and manage workflows.
   - Tools: Experience with Apache Airflow, Talend, or Informatica.
   - Processes: Understanding of data extraction, transformation, and loading techniques.
   - ETL Concepts: Understand the ETL process and its importance in data engineering.

PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE
   - Certifications: Consider certifications like Google Cloud Professional Data Engineer or AWS Certified Data Analytics.
   - Projects: Work on projects that integrate these skills. For example, create a data pipeline that extracts data using SQL, processes it with PySpark, and loads it into 
     Snowflake.
   - Certifications: Consider certifications like Microsoft Certified: Azure Data Engineer Associate or Snowflake SnowPro Core Certification.
