Semantic Model in Power BI

"semantic model" in Power BI is a structured layer that represents a single source of truth for data, containing relationships between tables, calculated measures, and business logic, allowing users to easily build reports and visualizations based on a unified understanding of the data, essentially transforming raw data into a user-friendly format for analysis. 
Key points about semantic models in Power BI:
Function:
It acts as a logical layer that organizes data from various sources into a coherent structure, making it accessible for reporting and analysis. 
Components:
A semantic model includes tables, columns, relationships between tables, calculated measures, and other business-specific calculations. 
Benefits:
Consistency: Multiple reports can be built on the same semantic model, ensuring data consistency across the organization. 
Ease of use: By providing a clear, business-oriented view of the data, it simplifies analysis for non-technical users. 
Flexibility: Users can easily add new calculations and insights to the model based on business needs. 
Creation:
Semantic models are built within Power BI Desktop by defining data connections, transformations, relationships, and calculations.


METRIC vs ATTRIBUTE (FACT VS DIMENSION)

In a database context, a "metric" refers to a quantifiable value that measures a specific aspect of data, like sales revenue or website traffic, while an "attribute" is a descriptive characteristic that provides context to the data, like customer location or product category, which cannot be directly measured but can be used to segment and analyze metrics; essentially, metrics are the "what" you are measuring, and attributes are the "how" you categorize that data. 
Key Differences:
Measurability:
Metrics are always numerical values that can be calculated and compared, while attributes are qualitative descriptions that cannot be directly measured. 
Function:
Metrics are used to track performance and progress, while attributes are used to organize and filter data by specific categories. 
Example:
Metric: "Total sales amount"
Attribute: "Sales region" 
How they work together:
You can use attributes to slice and dice metrics in a report, for example, analyzing "total sales amount" by "sales region" to see which region generated the most revenue
