Semantic Model
"semantic model" in Power BI is a structured layer that represents a single source of truth for data, containing relationships between tables, calculated measures, and business logic, allowing users to easily build reports and visualizations based on a unified understanding of the data, essentially transforming raw data into a user-friendly format for analysis. 
Key points about semantic models in Power BI:
Function:
It acts as a logical layer that organizes data from various sources into a coherent structure, making it accessible for reporting and analysis. 
Components:
A semantic model includes tables, columns, relationships between tables, calculated measures, and other business-specific calculations. 
Benefits:
Consistency: Multiple reports can be built on the same semantic model, ensuring data consistency across the organization. 
Ease of use: By providing a clear, business-oriented view of the data, it simplifies analysis for non-technical users. 
Flexibility: Users can easily add new calculations and insights to the model based on business needs. 
Creation:
Semantic models are built within Power BI Desktop by defining data connections, transformations, relationships, and calculations.
