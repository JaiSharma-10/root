/*select count(City) as total_number_of_record

from station;*/

select count(distinct city) from station;

 

select LENGTH("jaivardhan");  -- in MySQL

 

QUESTION-

Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

The STATION table is described as follows:

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

Sample Input

For example, CITY has four entries: DEF, ABC, PQRS and WXY.

Sample Output

ABC 3

PQRS 4

Explanation

When ordered alphabetically, the CITY names are listed as ABC, DEF, PQRS, and WXY, with lengths  and . The longest name is PQRS, but there are  options for shortest named city. Choose ABC, because it comes first alphabetically.

 

Solution-

(select city,LENGTH(city)

from station

order by

LENGTH(city) asc

,city asc

limit 1)

Explanation:

Customer with id = 23 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 12.

Customer with id = 9 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 13.

Customer with id = 30 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.

Customer with id = 54 visited the mall three times. During 2 visits they did not make any transactions, and during one visit they made 3 transactions.

Customer with id = 96 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.

As we can see, users with IDs 30 and 96 visited the mall one time without making any transactions. Also, user 54 visited the mall twice and did not make any transactions.

Nested CASE statements in SQL

One of the advanced use-cases for CASE statements in SQL is to nest CASE statements within another CASE statement. This technique is useful when you have sub-conditions that need to be evaluated.

 

SELECT personID, lastName, firstName, [state],

CASE

              WHEN [state] = 'Minnesota'

              THEN (CASE WHEN income > 100000 THEN 'over'

                                           ELSE 'not over' END)

              WHEN [state] = 'California'

THEN (CASE WHEN income > 150000 THEN 'over'

                                           ELSE 'not over' END)

              WHEN [state] = 'Kentucky'

THEN (CASE WHEN income > 75000 THEN 'over'

                                           ELSE 'not over' END)

END over_income

FROM #Temp_table

 

 

 

It is possible to use CASE to filter data in the WHERE clause of a SQL query. This can be helpful if you want to restrict records based on logical conditions.

 

SELECT personID, lastName, firstName, [state]

FROM #Temp_table

where(

CASE

              WHEN [state] = 'Minnesota' AND Income >= 100000 THEN 'MN'

              WHEN [state] = 'California' THEN 'CA'

              WHEN [state] = 'Kentucky' THEN 'KY'

END) = 'MN'

 

 

Aggregating using CASE statements in SQL

One of the popular ways to use the CASE statement in SQL is for counting records that would be cumbersome to transpose using a count() function. For example, say we want to output a single row result set that returns the number of records from each state where the income is greater than or equal to 100,000:

 

select sum(CASE

                             WHEN [state] = 'Minnesota' and income >= 100000 THEN 1

                             ELSE 0

                             END) MN_counts,

              sum(CASE WHEN [state] = 'California' and income >= 100000 THEN 1

                             ELSE 0

                             END) CA_counts,

              sum(CASE WHEN [state] = 'Kentucky' and income >= 100000 THEN 1

                             ELSE 0

                             END) KY_counts

from #temp_table

========================================CTE

What are Common Table Expressions (CTEs)?

A Common Table Expression (CTE) is the result set of a query which exists temporarily and for use only within the context of a larger query. Much like a derived table, the result of a CTE is not stored and exists only for the duration of the query.

 

=Example use cases include

1.Needing to reference a derived table multiple times in a single query

2.An alternative to creating a view in the database

3.Performing the same calculation multiple times over across multiple query components

 

-- define CTE:

WITH Cost_by_Month AS

(SELECT campaign_id AS campaign,

       TO_CHAR(created_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS month,

       SUM(cost) AS monthly_cost

FROM marketing

WHERE created_date BETWEEN NOW() - INTERVAL '3 MONTH' AND NOW()

GROUP BY 1, 2

ORDER BY 1, 2)

 

-- use CTE in subsequent query:

SELECT campaign, avg(monthly_cost) as "Avg Monthly Cost"

FROM Cost_by_Month

GROUP BY campaign

ORDER BY campaign

 

--example

        sum(case when occupation = "Doctor" then 1 else 0 end) as d,

        sum(case when occupation ="singer" then 1 else 0 end) as s,

        sum(case when occupation = "Actor" then 1 else 0 end) as a,

There are two types of CTEs: Recursive and Non-Recursive

 

Non-Recursive: where the CTE doesnâ€™t use any recursion, or repeated processing in of a sub-routine.

WHERE database_id <= 10

    ) 

 

SELECT * FROM ROWCTE

 

 

Recursive CTE:

Recursive CTEs are use repeated procedural loops aka recursion. The recursive query call themselves until the query satisfied the condition. In a recursive CTE we should provide a where condition to terminate the recursion.

 

Declare @RowNo int =1;

-----QUESTION-

 

 

Pivot the Occupation column in OCCUPATIONS so that each Name is sorted alphabetically and displayed underneath its corresponding Occupation. The output column headers should be Doctor, Professor, Singer, and Actor, respectively.

 

Note: Print NULL when there are no more names corresponding to an occupation.

 

Input Format

 

The OCCUPATIONS table is described as follows:

 

Occupation will only contain one of the following values: Doctor, Professor, Singer or Actor.

 

Sample Output

 

Jenny    Ashley     Meera  Jane

Samantha Christeen  Priya  Julia

NULL     Ketty      NULL   Maria

Explanation

 

The first column is an alphabetically ordered list of Doctor names.

The second column is an alphabetically ordered list of Professor names.

The third column is an alphabetically ordered list of Singer names.

The fourth column is an alphabetically ordered list of Actor names.

The empty cell data for columns with less than the maximum number of names per occupation (in this case, the Professor and Actor columns) are filled with NULL values.

 

 

 

 

---------WHAT IS PIVOT

In a pivot query, you specify the columns that you want to pivot on, as well as the aggregate function(s) that you want to apply to the values in those columns. The result of the query is a new table with the pivoted columns as its headers.

 

Assuming you have a sample table called sales_data with the following columns and data:

 

Product Name   Sales Date          Sales Amount

Product A                          2022-01-01        500

Product B                          2022-01-01        750

Product C                          2022-01-01        1000

Product A                          2022-01-02        800

Product B                          2022-01-02        900

Product C                          2022-01-02        1200

To pivot this data by Product Name, you can use the following query:

 

Code:

SELECT

  `Sales Date`,

  MAX(CASE WHEN `Product Name` = 'Product A' then `Sales Amount` END) AS `Product A`,

  MAX(CASE WHEN `Product Name` = 'Product B' then `Sales Amount` END) AS `Product B`,

  MAX(CASE WHEN `Product Name` = 'Product C' than `Sales Amount` END) AS `Product C`

FROM

  `sales_data`

GROUP BY

  `Sales Date`;

 

Output

Sales Date          Product A           Product B           Product C

2022-01-01        500                   750                 1000

2022-01-02        800                   900                 1200

 

 

---Dynamic Pivot Columns

Assuming you have a sample table called sales_data with the following columns and data:

 

Product Name   Sales Date          Sales Amount

Product A                          2022-01-01        500

Product B                          2022-01-01        750

Product C                          2022-01-01        1000

Product A                          2022-01-02        800

Product B                          2022-01-02        900

Product C                          2022-01-02        1200

Product D                         2022-01-02        1500

To pivot this data by Product Name, you can use dynamic pivot columns with the following query:

 

Code:

SET @sql = NULL;

SELECT

  GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT

    CONCAT('MAX(CASE WHEN `Product Name` = ''', `Product Name`, ''' THEN `Sales Amount` END) AS `', `Product Name`, '`')

  ) INTO @sql

FROM

  `sales_data`;

 

SET @sql = CONCAT('SELECT `Sales Date`, ', @sql, ' FROM `sales_data` GROUP BY `Sales Date`');

 

PREPARE stmt FROM @sql;

EXECUTE stmt;

DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt;

 

---The GROUP_CONCAT() function in MySQL is used to concatenate data from multiple rows into one field. This is an aggregate (GROUP BY) function that returns a String value if the group contains at least one non-NULL value. Otherwise, it returns NULL.

 

Output:

The output will be:

 

Sales Date          Product A           Product B           Product C           Product D

2022-01-01        500                   750                 1000                  NULL

2022-01-02        800                   900                 1200                  1500

 

 

--explaination

In this query, the first SELECT statement uses GROUP_CONCAT to dynamically generate the pivot columns based on the distinct Product Name values in the sales_data table.

 

The generated SQL statement is then stored in a user-defined variable @sql. The PREPARE statement is used to prepare the SQL statement in @sql, and the EXECUTE statement is used to execute the prepared statement. Finally, the DEALLOCATE PREPARE statement is used to deallocate the prepared statement.

 

This query will pivot the data so that Product Name becomes the column header, Sales Date becomes the row header, and the Sales Amount is the data associated with each Product Name and Sales Date combination. The dynamic pivot columns allow for flexibility in column values, making it easy to pivot data with unknown or varying column values.

You are given a table, BST, containing two columns: N and P, where N represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and P is the parent of N.

 

Write a query to find the node type of Binary Tree ordered by the value of the node. Output one of the following for each node:

 

Root: If node is root node. --main nodes.

Leaf: If node is leaf node. --lower most nodes.

Inner: If node is neither root nor leaf node.  --middle node

Explanation

 

The Binary Tree below illustrates the sample

=====================================================Nodes of binary tree.

There are three types of nodes in a binary tree.

 

Root: The root node is the treeâ€™s starting point. e,g node 5 is the root node in the above-shown tree.

Inner: An inner node is one that has a parent and at least one child. e,g nodes 2 and 8 are the inner nodes in the above-shown tree.

Leaf: The leaf node has a parent but no children nodes. It occurs at the last level of the tree. e,g nodes 1,3,6, and 9 are the leaf nodes in the above-shown tree.

 

=====================================================

 

Approach:

 

Logical Part: Identify Node: A node is a root if its parent is null.

A node is inner if it has a parent and at least one child. If a node occurs in the â€˜nâ€™ column as well as in the â€˜pâ€™ column then it is an inner node.

 

A node is a leaf if it never appears as a parent or it does not occur in the â€˜pâ€™ column.

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a type of Binary Tree data structure, where the following properties must be true for any node "X" in the tree:

 

The X node's left child and all of its descendants (children, children's children, and so on) have lower values than X's value.

The right child, and all its descendants have higher values than X's value.

Left and right subtrees must also be Binary Search Trees.

These properties makes it faster to search, add and delete values than a regular binary tree.

 

To make this as easy to understand and implement as possible, let us also assume that all values in a Binary Search Tree are unique.

 

 

 

Use the Binary Search Tree below to better understand these concepts and relevant terminology.

 

The size of a tree is the number of nodes in it (n).

 

A subtree starts with one of the nodes in the tree as a local root, and consists of that node and all its descendants.

 

The descendants of a node are all the child nodes of that node, and all their child nodes, and so on. Just start with a node, and the descendants will be all nodes that are connected below that node.

 

The node's height is the maximum number of edges between that node and a leaf node.

 

A node's in-order successor is the node that comes after it if we were to do in-order traversal. In-order traversal of the BST above would result in node 13 coming before node 14, and so the successor of node 13 is node 14.

Table: Activity

+----------------+---------+

| Column Name    | Type    |

+----------------+---------+

| machine_id     | int     |

| process_id     | int     |

| activity_type  | enum    |

| timestamp      | float   |

+----------------+---------+

The table shows the user activities for a factory website.

(machine_id, process_id, activity_type) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.

machine_id is the ID of a machine.

process_id is the ID of a process running on the machine with ID machine_id.

activity_type is an ENUM (category) of type ('start', 'end').

timestamp is a float representing the current time in seconds.

'start' means the machine starts the process at the given timestamp and 'end' means the machine ends the process at the given timestamp.

The 'start' timestamp will always be before the 'end' timestamp for every (machine_id, process_id) pair.

There is a factory website that has several machines each running the same number of processes. Write a solution to find the average time each machine takes to complete a process.

The time to complete a process is the 'end' timestamp minus the 'start' timestamp. The average time is calculated by the total time to complete every process on the machine divided by the number of processes that were run.

The resulting table should have the machine_id along with the average time as processing_time, which should be rounded to 3 decimal places.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input:

Activity table:

+------------+------------+---------------+-----------+

| machine_id | process_id | activity_type | timestamp |

+------------+------------+---------------+-----------+

| 0          | 0          | start         | 0.712     |

| 0          | 1          | start         | 3.140     |

| 0          | 1          | end           | 4.120     |

| 1          | 0          | start         | 0.550     |

| 1          | 0          | end           | 1.550     |

| 2          | 1          | end           | 5.000     |

+------------+------------+---------------+-----------+

Output:

| 2          | 1.456           |

+------------+-----------------+

Explanation:

There are 3 machines running 2 processes each.

Machine 0's average time is ((1.520 - 0.712) + (4.120 - 3.140)) / 2 = 0.894

Machine 1's average time is ((1.550 - 0.550) + (1.420 - 0.430)) / 2 = 0.995

Machine 2 s average time is ((4.512 - 4.100) + (5.000 - 2.500)) / 2

Table: Employee

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| department  | varchar |
| managerId   | int     |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name of an employee, their department, and the id of their manager.
If managerId is null, then the employee does not have a manager.
No employee will be the manager of themself.
 

Write a solution to find managers with at least five direct reports.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:

Table: Prices
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |

+---------------+---------+
(product_id, start_date, end_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the price of the product_id in the period from start_date to end_date.
For each product_id there will be no two overlapping periods. That means there will be no two intersecting periods for the same product_id.


 
Table: UnitsSold
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| purchase_date | date    |
| units         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
This table may contain duplicate rows.
Each row of this table indicates the date, units, and product_id of each product sold. 


 
Write a solution to find the average selling price for each product. average_price should be rounded to 2 decimal places.
Return the result table in any order.
The result format is in the following example.
 
Example 1:
Input: 
Prices table:
+------------+------------+------------+--------+
| product_id | start_date | end_date   | price  |

| 2          | 16.96         |
+------------+---------------+
Explanation: 
Average selling price = Total Price of Product / Number of products sold.
Average selling price for product 1 = ((100 * 5) + (15 * 20)) / 115 = 6.96
Average selling price for product 2 = ((200 * 15) + (30 * 30)) / 230 = 16.96

| query_name  | varchar |
| result      | varchar |
| position    | int     |
| rating      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
This table may have duplicate rows.
This table contains information collected from some queries on a database.
The position column has a value from 1 to 500.
The rating column has a value from 1 to 5. Query with rating less than 3 is a poor query.


 
We define query quality as:
The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.
We also define poor query percentage as:
The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.
Write a solution to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.
Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.
Return the result table in any order.
The result format is in the following example. 


--ratio rating/position --avg(ratio) group by query_name 
--poor_query_percentage  = sum(case  when rating <3 then 1 else 0 end)/(count of query_name ) *100
