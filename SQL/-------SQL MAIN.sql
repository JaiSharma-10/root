Unique value count
/*select count(City) as total_number_of_record
from station;*/
select count(distinct city) from station;
select LENGTH("jaivardhan");  -- in MySQL
QUESTION-
Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.
The STATION table is described as follows:
where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.
Sample Input
For example, CITY has four entries: DEF, ABC, PQRS and WXY.
Sample Output
ABC 3
PQRS 4
Explanation
When ordered alphabetically, the CITY names are listed as ABC, DEF, PQRS, and WXY, with lengths  and . The longest name is PQRS, but there are  options for shortest named city. Choose ABC, because it comes first alphabetically.
Solution-
(select city,LENGTH(city)
from station
order by
LENGTH(city) asc
,city asc
limit 1)
union all
(select city,LENGTH(city)
from station
order by
LENGTH(city) desc
,city desc
limit 1);

+-------------+----------------+
Explanation:
Customer with id = 23 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 12.
Customer with id = 9 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 13.
Customer with id = 30 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.
Customer with id = 54 visited the mall three times. During 2 visits they did not make any transactions, and during one visit they made 3 transactions.
Customer with id = 96 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.
As we can see, users with IDs 30 and 96 visited the mall one time without making any transactions. Also, user 54 visited the mall twice and did not make any transactions.
===================================solution
--query using derived table
select customer_id
                ,count(customer_id) as count_no_trans

============CASE Conditions
SELECT OrderID, Quantity,
CASE
    WHEN Quantity > 30 THEN 'The quantity is greater than 30'
    WHEN Quantity = 30 THEN 'The quantity is 30'
    ELSE 'The quantity is under 30'
END AS QuantityText
FROM OrderDetails;
Nested CASE statements in SQL
One of the advanced use-cases for CASE statements in SQL is to nest CASE statements within another CASE statement. This technique is useful when you have sub-conditions that need to be evaluated.
SELECT personID, lastName, firstName, [state],
CASE
              WHEN [state] = 'Minnesota'
              THEN (CASE WHEN income > 100000 THEN 'over'
                                           ELSE 'not over' END)
              WHEN [state] = 'California'
THEN (CASE WHEN income > 150000 THEN 'over'
                                           ELSE 'not over' END)
              WHEN [state] = 'Kentucky'
THEN (CASE WHEN income > 75000 THEN 'over'
                                           ELSE 'not over' END)
END over_income
FROM #Temp_table
It is possible to use CASE to filter data in the WHERE clause of a SQL query. This can be helpful if you want to restrict records based on logical conditions.
SELECT personID, lastName, firstName, [state]
FROM #Temp_table
where(
CASE
              WHEN [state] = 'Minnesota' AND Income >= 100000 THEN 'MN'
              WHEN [state] = 'California' THEN 'CA'
              WHEN [state] = 'Kentucky' THEN 'KY'
END) = 'MN'
Aggregating using CASE statements in SQL
One of the popular ways to use the CASE statement in SQL is for counting records that would be cumbersome to transpose using a count() function. For example, say we want to output a single row result set that returns the number of records from each state where the income is greater than or equal to 100,000:
select sum(CASE
                             WHEN [state] = 'Minnesota' and income >= 100000 THEN 1
                             ELSE 0
                             END) MN_counts,
              sum(CASE WHEN [state] = 'California' and income >= 100000 THEN 1
                             ELSE 0
                             END) CA_counts,
              sum(CASE WHEN [state] = 'Kentucky' and income >= 100000 THEN 1
                             ELSE 0
                             END) KY_counts
from #temp_table
Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table
Values in the tuple  form an Isosceles triangle, because .
Values in the tuple  form an Equilateral triangle, because . Values in the tuple  form a Scalene triangle, because .
Values in the tuple  cannot form a triangle because the combined value of sides  and  is not larger than that of side .

--QUESTION-
Generate the following two result sets:
Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).
Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:
There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.
where [occupation_count] is the number of occurrences of an occupation in OCCUPATIONS and [occupation] is the lowercase occupation name. If more than one Occupation has the same [occupation_count], they should be ordered alphabetically.
Note: There will be at least two entries in the table for each type of occupation.
Input Format
The OCCUPATIONS table is described as follows:  Occupation will only contain one of the following values: Doctor, Professor, Singer or Actor.
Sample Input
An OCCUPATIONS table that contains the following records:

========================================CTE
What are Common Table Expressions (CTEs)?
A Common Table Expression (CTE) is the result set of a query which exists temporarily and for use only within the context of a larger query. Much like a derived table, the result of a CTE is not stored and exists only for the duration of the query.
=Example use cases include
1.Needing to reference a derived table multiple times in a single query
2.An alternative to creating a view in the database
3.Performing the same calculation multiple times over across multiple query components
-- define CTE:
WITH Cost_by_Month AS
(SELECT campaign_id AS campaign,
       TO_CHAR(created_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS month,
       SUM(cost) AS monthly_cost
FROM marketing
WHERE created_date BETWEEN NOW() - INTERVAL '3 MONTH' AND NOW()
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1, 2)
-- use CTE in subsequent query:
SELECT campaign, avg(monthly_cost) as "Avg Monthly Cost"
FROM Cost_by_Month
GROUP BY campaign
ORDER BY campaign
--example
with derived_table AS
(select
        sum(case when occupation = "Doctor" then 1 else 0 end) as d,
        sum(case when occupation ="singer" then 1 else 0 end) as s,

There are two types of CTEs: Recursive and Non-Recursive
Non-Recursive: where the CTE doesnâ€™t use any recursion, or repeated processing in of a sub-routine.
;with ROWCTE(ROWNO) as  -- ROWNO is column name it is optional
   ( 
     SELECT
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY name ASC) AS ROWNO
FROM sys.databases
WHERE database_id <= 10
    ) 
SELECT * FROM ROWCTE
Recursive CTE:
Recursive CTEs are use repeated procedural loops aka recursion. The recursive query call themselves until the query satisfied the condition. In a recursive CTE we should provide a where condition to terminate the recursion.
Declare @RowNo int =1;
;with ROWCTE as 
   ( 
      SELECT @RowNo as ROWNO

====================================Pivot
-----QUESTION-
Pivot the Occupation column in OCCUPATIONS so that each Name is sorted alphabetically and displayed underneath its corresponding Occupation. The output column headers should be Doctor, Professor, Singer, and Actor, respectively.
Note: Print NULL when there are no more names corresponding to an occupation.
Input Format
The OCCUPATIONS table is described as follows:
Occupation will only contain one of the following values: Doctor, Professor, Singer or Actor.
Sample Output
Jenny    Ashley     Meera  Jane
Samantha Christeen  Priya  Julia
NULL     Ketty      NULL   Maria
Explanation
The first column is an alphabetically ordered list of Doctor names.
The second column is an alphabetically ordered list of Professor names.
The third column is an alphabetically ordered list of Singer names.
The fourth column is an alphabetically ordered list of Actor names.
The empty cell data for columns with less than the maximum number of names per occupation (in this case, the Professor and Actor columns) are filled with NULL values.

In a pivot query, you specify the columns that you want to pivot on, as well as the aggregate function(s) that you want to apply to the values in those columns. The result of the query is a new table with the pivoted columns as its headers.
Assuming you have a sample table called sales_data with the following columns and data:
Product Name   Sales Date          Sales Amount
Product A                          2022-01-01        500
Product B                          2022-01-01        750
Product C                          2022-01-01        1000
Product A                          2022-01-02        800
Product B                          2022-01-02        900
Product C                          2022-01-02        1200
To pivot this data by Product Name, you can use the following query:
Code:
SELECT
  `Sales Date`,
  MAX(CASE WHEN `Product Name` = 'Product A' then `Sales Amount` END) AS `Product A`,
  MAX(CASE WHEN `Product Name` = 'Product B' then `Sales Amount` END) AS `Product B`,
  MAX(CASE WHEN `Product Name` = 'Product C' than `Sales Amount` END) AS `Product C`
FROM
  `sales_data`
GROUP BY
  `Sales Date`;
Output
Sales Date          Product A           Product B           Product C
2022-01-01        500                   750                 1000
2022-01-02        800                   900                 1200
---Dynamic Pivot Columns
Assuming you have a sample table called sales_data with the following columns and data:
Product Name   Sales Date          Sales Amount
Product A                          2022-01-01        500
Product B                          2022-01-01        750
Product C                          2022-01-01        1000
Product A                          2022-01-02        800
Product B                          2022-01-02        900
Product C                          2022-01-02        1200
Product D                         2022-01-02        1500
To pivot this data by Product Name, you can use dynamic pivot columns with the following query:
Code:
SET @sql = NULL;
SELECT
  GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT
    CONCAT('MAX(CASE WHEN `Product Name` = ''', `Product Name`, ''' THEN `Sales Amount` END) AS `', `Product Name`, '`')
  ) INTO @sql
FROM
  `sales_data`;
SET @sql = CONCAT('SELECT `Sales Date`, ', @sql, ' FROM `sales_data` GROUP BY `Sales Date`');
PREPARE stmt FROM @sql;
EXECUTE stmt;
DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt;
---The GROUP_CONCAT() function in MySQL is used to concatenate data from multiple rows into one field. This is an aggregate (GROUP BY) function that returns a String value if the group contains at least one non-NULL value. Otherwise, it returns NULL.
Output:
The output will be:
Sales Date          Product A           Product B           Product C           Product D
2022-01-01        500                   750                 1000                  NULL
2022-01-02        800                   900                 1200                  1500
--explaination
In this query, the first SELECT statement uses GROUP_CONCAT to dynamically generate the pivot columns based on the distinct Product Name values in the sales_data table.
The generated SQL statement is then stored in a user-defined variable @sql. The PREPARE statement is used to prepare the SQL statement in @sql, and the EXECUTE statement is used to execute the prepared statement. Finally, the DEALLOCATE PREPARE statement is used to deallocate the prepared statement.
This query will pivot the data so that Product Name becomes the column header, Sales Date becomes the row header, and the Sales Amount is the data associated with each Product Name and Sales Date combination. The dynamic pivot columns allow for flexibility in column values, making it easy to pivot data with unknown or varying column values.

You are given a table, BST, containing two columns: N and P, where N represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and P is the parent of N.
Write a query to find the node type of Binary Tree ordered by the value of the node. Output one of the following for each node:
Root: If node is root node. --main nodes.
Leaf: If node is leaf node. --lower most nodes.
Inner: If node is neither root nor leaf node.  --middle node

Explanation
The Binary Tree below illustrates the sample
=====================================================Nodes of binary tree.
There are three types of nodes in a binary tree.
Root: The root node is the treeâ€™s starting point. e,g node 5 is the root node in the above-shown tree.
Inner: An inner node is one that has a parent and at least one child. e,g nodes 2 and 8 are the inner nodes in the above-shown tree.
Leaf: The leaf node has a parent but no children nodes. It occurs at the last level of the tree. e,g nodes 1,3,6, and 9 are the leaf nodes in the above-shown tree.
=====================================================
Approach:
Logical Part: Identify Node: A node is a root if its parent is null.
A node is inner if it has a parent and at least one child. If a node occurs in the â€˜nâ€™ column as well as in the â€˜pâ€™ column then it is an inner node.
A node is a leaf if it never appears as a parent or it does not occur in the â€˜pâ€™ column.
=====================================================what is the Binary tree
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a type of Binary Tree data structure, where the following properties must be true for any node "X" in the tree:
The X node's left child and all of its descendants (children, children's children, and so on) have lower values than X's value.
The right child, and all its descendants have higher values than X's value.
Left and right subtrees must also be Binary Search Trees.
These properties makes it faster to search, add and delete values than a regular binary tree.
To make this as easy to understand and implement as possible, let us also assume that all values in a Binary Search Tree are unique.
Use the Binary Search Tree below to better understand these concepts and relevant terminology.
The size of a tree is the number of nodes in it (n).
A subtree starts with one of the nodes in the tree as a local root, and consists of that node and all its descendants.
The descendants of a node are all the child nodes of that node, and all their child nodes, and so on. Just start with a node, and the descendants will be all nodes that are connected below that node.
The node's height is the maximum number of edges between that node and a leaf node.
A node's in-order successor is the node that comes after it if we were to do in-order traversal. In-order traversal of the BST above would result in node 13 coming before node 14, and so the successor of node 13 is node 14.

Table: Activity
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| machine_id     | int     |
| process_id     | int     |
| activity_type  | enum    |
| timestamp      | float   |
+----------------+---------+
The table shows the user activities for a factory website.
(machine_id, process_id, activity_type) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
machine_id is the ID of a machine.
process_id is the ID of a process running on the machine with ID machine_id.
activity_type is an ENUM (category) of type ('start', 'end').
timestamp is a float representing the current time in seconds.
'start' means the machine starts the process at the given timestamp and 'end' means the machine ends the process at the given timestamp.
The 'start' timestamp will always be before the 'end' timestamp for every (machine_id, process_id) pair.
There is a factory website that has several machines each running the same number of processes. Write a solution to find the average time each machine takes to complete a process.
The time to complete a process is the 'end' timestamp minus the 'start' timestamp. The average time is calculated by the total time to complete every process on the machine divided by the number of processes that were run.
The resulting table should have the machine_id along with the average time as processing_time, which should be rounded to 3 decimal places.
Return the result table in any order.
The result format is in the following example.
Example 1:
Input:
Activity table:
+------------+------------+---------------+-----------+
| machine_id | process_id | activity_type | timestamp |
+------------+------------+---------------+-----------+
| 0          | 0          | start         | 0.712     |
| 0          | 0          | end           | 1.520     |
| 0          | 1          | start         | 3.140     |
| 0          | 1          | end           | 4.120     |
| 1          | 0          | start         | 0.550     |
| 1          | 0          | end           | 1.550     |
| 1          | 1          | start         | 0.430     |

| 2          | 1          | start         | 2.500     |
| 2          | 1          | end           | 5.000     |
+------------+------------+---------------+-----------+
Output:
+------------+-----------------+
| machine_id | processing_time |
+------------+-----------------+
| 0          | 0.894           |
| 1          | 0.995           |
| 2          | 1.456           |
+------------+-----------------+
Explanation:
There are 3 machines running 2 processes each.
Machine 0's average time is ((1.520 - 0.712) + (4.120 - 3.140)) / 2 = 0.894
Machine 1's average time is ((1.550 - 0.550) + (1.420 - 0.430)) / 2 = 0.995
Machine 2 s average time is ((4.512 - 4.100) + (5.000 - 2.500)) / 2

 570. Managers with at Least 5 Direct Reports

Hint
SQL Schema
Pandas Schema
Table: Employee

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| department  | varchar |
| managerId   | int     |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name of an employee, their department, and the id of their manager.
If managerId is null, then the employee does not have a manager.
No employee will be the manager of themself.
 

Write a solution to find managers with at least five direct reports.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input:

+------------+---------------+
Explanation: 
Average selling price = Total Price of Product / Number of products sold.
Average selling price for product 1 = ((100 * 5) + (15 * 20)) / 115 = 6.96
Average selling price for product 2 = ((200 * 15) + (30 * 30)) / 230 = 16.96

+-------------+---------+
This table may have duplicate rows.
This table contains information collected from some queries on a database.
The position column has a value from 1 to 500.
The rating column has a value from 1 to 5. Query with rating less than 3 is a poor query.


 
We define query quality as:
The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.
We also define poor query percentage as:
The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.
Write a solution to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.
Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.
Return the result table in any order.
The result format is in the following example. 


--ratio rating/position --avg(ratio) group by query_name 
--poor_query_percentage  = sum(case  when rating <3 then 1 else 0 end)/(count of query_name ) *100

I am using MySQL. Here is my schema:

Suppliers(sid: integer, sname: string, address string)

Parts(pid: integer, pname: string, color: string)

Catalog(sid: integer, pid: integer, cost: real)

(primary keys are bolded)

I am trying to write a query to select all parts that are made by at least two suppliers:

-- Find the pids of parts supplied by at least two different suppliers.
SELECT c1.pid                      -- select the pid
FROM Catalog AS c1                 -- from the Catalog table
WHERE c1.pid IN (                  -- where that pid is in the set:
    SELECT c2.pid                  -- of pids
    FROM Catalog AS c2             -- from catalog
    WHERE c2.pid = c1.pid AND COUNT(c2.sid) >= 2 -- where there are at least two corresponding sids
);

You need to use HAVING, not WHERE.

The difference is: the WHERE clause filters which rows MySQL selects. Then MySQL groups the rows together and aggregates the numbers for your COUNT function.

HAVING is like WHERE, only it happens after the COUNT value has been computed, so it will work as you expect. Rewrite your subquery as:

(                  -- where that pid is in the set:
SELECT c2.pid                  -- of pids
FROM Catalog AS c2             -- from catalog
WHERE c2.pid = c1.pid
HAVING COUNT(c2.sid) >= 2)

--use of having vs where 

--The difference between the having and where clause in SQL is that the where clause cannot be used with aggregates, but the having clause can.

--PERFORMING SQL OPERATIONS WITH NATIVE DYNAMIC SQL


--How to use native dynamic SQL (dynamic SQL for short), a PL/SQL interface that makes your programs more flexible, by building and processing SQL statements at run time.

--With dynamic SQL, you can directly execute any kind of SQL statement (even data definition and data control statements). You can build statements where you do not know table names, WHERE clauses, and other information in advance.

--What Is Dynamic SQL?
--Some programs must build and process SQL statements where some information is not known in advance. A reporting application might build different SELECT statements for the various reports it generates, substituting new table and column names and ordering or grouping by different columns. Database management applications might issue statements such as CREATE, DROP, and GRANT that cannot be coded directly in a PL/SQL program. These statements are called dynamic SQL statements.

--Dynamic SQL statements built as character strings built at run time. The strings contain the text of a SQL statement or PL/SQL block. They can also contain placeholders for bind arguments. Placeholder names are prefixed by a colon, and the names themselves do not matter. For example, PL/SQL makes no distinction between the following strings:

'DELETE FROM emp WHERE sal > :my_sal AND comm < :my_comm'
'DELETE FROM emp WHERE sal > :s AND comm < :c'
--To process most dynamic SQL statements, you use the EXECUTE IMMEDIATE statement. To process a multi-row query (SELECT statement), you use the OPEN-FOR, FETCH, and CLOSE statements.


--DYNAMIC SQL

--EXECUTE IMMEDIATE
--for multi-row query use OPEN_FOR , FETCH and CLose 


--USING THE EXECUTE IMMEDIATE STATEMENT

--The EXECUTE IMMEDIATE statement prepares (parses) and immediately executes a dynamic SQL statement or an anonymous PL/SQL block.
--The main argument to EXECUTE IMMEDIATE is the string containing the SQL statement to execute. You can build up the string using concatenation, or use a predefined string.
--For example

  SET @SQL = @SQL + 'SELECT a.FAC_CODE, A.post_DATE, A.INSERT_DATE, A.TOT_CHRGS, A.TOT_PYMTS, A.TOT_AR, A.VALID_TOTAL_CHRGS, A.VALID_TOTAL_PMNTS, A.VALID_TOTAL_AR
						FROM ' + QUOTENAME(@DatabaseName) + '.dbo.DATA_RECON a with (nolock)
						UNION ALL '
						
--Except for multi-row queries, the dynamic string can contain any SQL statement (without the final semicolon) or any PL/SQL block (with the final semicolon). The string can also contain placeholders, arbitrary names preceded by a colon, for bind arguments. In this case, you specify which PL/SQL variables correspond to the placeholders with the INTO, USING, and RETURNING INTO clauses.

--You can only use placeholders in places where you can substitute variables in the SQL statement, such as conditional tests in WHERE clauses. You cannot use placeholders for the names of schema objects. 

--Used only for single-row queries, the INTO clause specifies the variables or record into which column values are retrieved. For each value retrieved by the query, there must be a corresponding, type-compatible variable or field in the INTO clause.

--Used only for DML statements that have a RETURNING clause (without a BULK COLLECT clause), the RETURNING INTO clause specifies the variables into which column values are returned. For each value returned by the DML statement, there must be a corresponding, type-compatible variable in the RETURNING INTO clause.

--You can place all bind arguments in the USING clause. The default parameter mode is IN. For DML statements that have a RETURNING clause, you can place OUT arguments in the RETURNING INTO clause without specifying the parameter mode. If you use both the USING clause and the RETURNING INTO clause, the USING clause can contain only IN arguments.

--At run time, bind arguments replace corresponding placeholders in the dynamic string. Every placeholder must be associated with a bind argument in the USING clause and/or RETURNING INTO clause. You can use numeric, character, and string literals as bind arguments, but you cannot use Boolean literals (TRUE, FALSE, and NULL). To pass nulls to the dynamic string, you must use a workaround.

--Dynamic SQL supports all the SQL datatypes. For example, define variables and bind arguments(dynamic) can be collections, LOBs, instances of an object type, and refs.

--As a rule, dynamic SQL does not support PL/SQL-specific types. For example, define variables and bind arguments cannot be Booleans or associative arrays. The only exception is that a PL/SQL record can appear in the INTO clause.

--You can execute a dynamic SQL statement repeatedly using new values for the bind arguments. However, you incur some overhead because EXECUTE IMMEDIATE re-prepares the dynamic string before every execution.


--Now below are the example from net after that i will put examples from Cognizant

--Example 7-1 Some Examples of Dynamic SQL

--The following PL/SQL block contains several examples of dynamic SQL:

DECLARE
   sql_stmt    VARCHAR2(200);
   plsql_block VARCHAR2(500);
   emp_id      NUMBER(4) := 7566;
   salary      NUMBER(7,2);
   dept_id     NUMBER(2) := 50;
   dept_name   VARCHAR2(14) := 'PERSONNEL';
   location    VARCHAR2(13) := 'DALLAS';
   emp_rec     emp%ROWTYPE;
BEGIN
   EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'CREATE TABLE bonus (id NUMBER, amt NUMBER)';
   sql_stmt := 'INSERT INTO dept VALUES (:1, :2, :3)';
   EXECUTE IMMEDIATE sql_stmt USING dept_id, dept_name, location;
   sql_stmt := 'SELECT * FROM emp WHERE empno = :id';
   EXECUTE IMMEDIATE sql_stmt INTO emp_rec USING emp_id;
   plsql_block := 'BEGIN emp_pkg.raise_salary(:id, :amt); END;';
   EXECUTE IMMEDIATE plsql_block USING 7788, 500;
   sql_stmt := 'UPDATE emp SET sal = 2000 WHERE empno = :1
      RETURNING sal INTO :2';
   EXECUTE IMMEDIATE sql_stmt USING emp_id RETURNING INTO salary;
   EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'DELETE FROM dept WHERE deptno = :num'
      USING dept_id;
   EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'ALTER SESSION SET SQL_TRACE TRUE';
END;
/
--Example 7-2 Dynamic SQL Procedure that Accepts Table Name and WHERE Clause

--In the example below, a standalone procedure accepts the name of a database table and an optional WHERE-clause condition. If you omit the condition, the procedure deletes all rows from the table. Otherwise, the procedure deletes only those rows that meet the condition.

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE delete_rows (
   table_name IN VARCHAR2,
   condition IN VARCHAR2 DEFAULT NULL) AS
   where_clause VARCHAR2(100) := ' WHERE ' || condition;
BEGIN
   IF condition IS NULL THEN where_clause := NULL; END IF;
   EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'DELETE FROM ' || table_name || where_clause;

----Explaination of the above query
-------------------------------
Let's break this down step-by-step. Here's what this SQL script does and an explanation of each component:

 Server and Database Components
- `AHV-SISDRCSTG01.accretivehealth.local`: This appears to be the server name.
- `Recon_Total`, `Recon_Valid`, `AR-InsertDate`, `Recon abs`: These look like they could be names of tables or columns in your database that are being referenced or manipulated by the script, but they are not directly used in this script.

 Performance Tuning Concepts
- `SET NOCOUNT ON`: This statement prevents the message that shows the number of rows affected by a T-SQL statement from being returned. This can improve performance by reducing network traffic.
- `SET NOCOUNT OFF`: This turns the counting of affected rows back on.

 Declaration of Variables
- `DECLARE @DatabaseName NVARCHAR(128)`: Declares a variable to hold database names.
- `DECLARE @SQL NVARCHAR(MAX) = ''`: Declares a variable to build a dynamic SQL query.

 Cursor Setup
- `DECLARE DatabaseCursor CURSOR FOR`: This sets up a cursor to iterate over databases that meet certain conditions.
- `SELECT name FROM sys.databases WHERE state = 0 AND right(name,3) = 'DRC' ORDER BY name`: This query selects the names of online databases whose names end with 'DRC'.

 Opening and Fetching from Cursor
- `OPEN DatabaseCursor`: Opens the cursor.
- `FETCH NEXT FROM DatabaseCursor INTO @DatabaseName`: Fetches the next database name into the variable `@DatabaseName`.

 Building the Union Query
- `WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0`: Loop through each fetched database name.
- `SET @SQL = @SQL + 'SELECT ... FROM ' + QUOTENAME(@DatabaseName) + '.dbo.DATA_RECON a with (nolock) UNION ALL '`: This line builds a dynamic SQL query by concatenating the current database name into the query string. `QUOTENAME(@DatabaseName)` safely adds the database name.

 Closing and Deallocating Cursor
- `CLOSE DatabaseCursor`: Closes the cursor when done.
- `DEALLOCATE DatabaseCursor`: Releases the cursor resources.

 Executing the Union Query
- `SET @SQL = LEFT(@SQL, LEN(@SQL) - LEN('UNION ALL '))`: Removes the last 'UNION ALL' from the query.
- `EXEC sp_executesql @SQL`: Executes the dynamically built SQL query.

 Example: Built Dynamic Query
```sql
SELECT a.FAC_CODE, A.post_DATE, A.INSERT_DATE, A.TOT_CHRGS, A.TOT_PYMTS *-1 TOT_PYMTS, A.Tot_Adj *-1 Tot_Adj, A.TOT_AR, A.VALID_TOTAL_CHRGS, A.VALID_TOTAL_PMNTS *-1 VALID_TOTAL_PMNTS, A.VALID_TOTAL_Adj *-1 VALID_TOTAL_Adj, A.VALID_TOTAL_AR

The purpose of this script is to aggregate data from multiple databases ending with 'DRC' into a single result set by using a cursor to dynamically build and execute a
union query. Performance tuning concepts such as `SET NOCOUNT ON` and using `nolock` hints help optimize the query execution.

 Cursors in SQL Server
A cursor is a database object used to retrieve, manipulate, and navigate through a result set row by row. Hereâ€™s a detailed look at why you might use a cursor and how it works:

Use of Cursor:
1. Row-by-Row Processing: Cursors allow you to process each row individually, which is useful when the logic cannot be set-based.
2. Complex Operations: When you need to perform operations that require iterative processing, such as when each operation depends on the result of the previous one.
3. Procedural Logic: Ideal for scenarios where procedural logic is necessary, as it gives you more control over the flow of data manipulation.

Drawbacks of Using Cursors:
1. Performance: Cursors are often slower than set-based operations because they process rows individually, which can be resource-intensive.
2. Resource Usage: They can consume significant memory and CPU resources, especially with large result sets.

A simple example of how you might use a cursor in SQL Server to iterate over a list of rows. Let's say you have a table `Employee` and you want to process each employee's data individually:

 Example Scenario:
Imagine you have an `Employee` table with the following columns: `EmployeeID`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, and `Salary`. You want to give a bonus to each employee based on their current salary.

 Example Table Structure:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName NVARCHAR(50),
    LastName NVARCHAR(50),
    Salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

INSERT INTO Employee (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Salary)
VALUES 
(1, 'John', 'Doe', 50000.00),
(2, 'Jane', 'Smith', 60000.00),
(3, 'Bob', 'Johnson', 55000.00);
```

 Cursor Example:
This cursor will loop through each employee and increase their salary by 10%.

```sql
-- Disable row count message
SET NOCOUNT ON;

-- Declare variables to hold employee data
DECLARE @EmployeeID INT;
DECLARE @FirstName NVARCHAR(50);
DECLARE @LastName NVARCHAR(50);
DECLARE @Salary DECIMAL(10, 2);

-- Declare a cursor to fetch employee data
DECLARE EmployeeCursor CURSOR FOR
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Salary
FROM Employee;

-- Open the cursor
OPEN EmployeeCursor;

-- Fetch the first row from the cursor
FETCH NEXT FROM EmployeeCursor INTO @EmployeeID, @FirstName, @LastName, @Salary;

-- Loop through the result set
WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
BEGIN
    -- Print employee information (or perform any other operation)
    PRINT 'Updating salary for ' + @FirstName + ' ' + @LastName;

    -- Increase salary by 10%
    UPDATE Employee
    SET Salary = Salary * 1.10
    WHERE EmployeeID = @EmployeeID;

    -- Fetch the next row from the cursor
    FETCH NEXT FROM EmployeeCursor INTO @EmployeeID, @FirstName, @LastName, @Salary;
END;

-- Close and deallocate the cursor
CLOSE EmployeeCursor;
DEALLOCATE EmployeeCursor;

-- Enable row count message again
SET NOCOUNT OFF;
```

 Explanation:
1. Disable Row Count Messages: `SET NOCOUNT ON;` disables messages about the number of rows affected, which can improve performance.
2. Declare Variables: Variables are declared to hold data for each employee.
3. Declare Cursor: The cursor `EmployeeCursor` is declared to fetch employee data.
4. Open Cursor: The cursor is opened, and data is fetched from it.
5. Fetch and Process Data: The script loops through each row returned by the cursor. For each employee, it prints a message and updates their salary.
6. Close and Deallocate Cursor: The cursor is closed and deallocated to free up resources.
7. Enable Row Count Messages: `SET NOCOUNT OFF;` re-enables row count messages.

Cursors can be very useful in specific scenarios where row-by-row processing is necessary. However, always consider whether a set-based operation could achieve the same result more efficiently.

Performance Tuning Methods in SQL Server
To optimize SQL Server performance, you can employ various techniques beyond avoiding cursors. Here are some key methods:

1. Indexing:
   - Clustered and Non-Clustered Indexes: Improve the speed of data retrieval.
   - Covering Indexes: Ensure indexes contain all required columns for a query to avoid additional lookups.

2. Query Optimization:
   - Analyze Execution Plans: Use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to examine query execution plans and identify bottlenecks.
   - Rewriting Queries: Simplify or restructure queries to improve performance.

3. Use of SET Options:
   - SET NOCOUNT ON: Reduces network traffic by suppressing the message that indicates the number of rows affected by a T-SQL statement.
   - SET STATISTICS IO/TIME ON: Provides information about the amount of disk activity generated by your queries.

4. Temporary Tables and Table Variables:
   - Temporary Tables: Useful for storing intermediate results.
   - Table Variables: Better for smaller datasets and less likely to cause recompilation of queries.

5. Data Partitioning:
   - Partitioned Tables and Indexes: Distribute large tables across multiple storage structures to improve manageability and query performance.

6. Query Hints:
   - Force Join Orders: Use hints like `OPTION (FORCE ORDER)` to influence the query optimizerâ€™s choice of join order.
   - Max Degree of Parallelism: Control the number of processors used for query execution with `OPTION (MAXDOP)`.

7. Maintenance Plans:
   - Regular Index Maintenance: Rebuild or reorganize indexes to improve performance.
   - Update Statistics: Ensure query optimizer has up-to-date information for making decisions.

8. Hardware and Configuration:
   - Memory Allocation: Allocate sufficient memory for SQL Server.
   - Storage Optimization: Use fast SSDs for data storage and ensure proper disk I/O configurations.
   - Server Configuration: Optimize server settings, like `max server memory`, and network protocols.

 Example of Using Indexes
To illustrate, hereâ€™s how you might create an index to improve query performance:
```sql
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_DataRecon_InsertDate
ON DATA_RECON (INSERT_DATE);
```
	

------performance tuning concepts of SQL Server
--used in SP and SSIS
SET NOCOUNT ON

--Controls whether a message that shows the number of rows affected by a Transact-SQL statement or stored procedure is returned after the result set. 
--This message is an extra result set

--When SET NOCOUNT is ON, the count isn't returned. When SET NOCOUNT is OFF, the count is returned.
--The @@ROWCOUNT function is updated even when SET NOCOUNT is ON.

--SET NOCOUNT ON prevents the sending of DONEINPROC messages to the client for each statement in a stored procedure. 
--For stored procedures that contain several statements that don't return much actual data, or for procedures that contain Transact-SQL loops, 
--setting SET NOCOUNT to ON can provide a significant performance boost, because network traffic is greatly reduced.

--The setting specified by SET NOCOUNT is in effect at execute or run time and not at parse time.

Execution plan overview

SQL Server  Azure SQL Database  Azure SQL Managed Instance

To be able to execute queries, the SQL Server Database Engine must analyze the statement to determine an efficient way to access the
required data and process it. This analysis is handled by a component called the Query Optimizer. The input to the Query Optimizer 
consists of the query, the database schema (table and index definitions), and the database statistics. The Query Optimizer builds 
one or more query execution plans, sometimes referred to as query plans or execution plans. The Query Optimizer chooses a query 
plan using a set of heuristics to balance compilation time and plan optimality in order to find a good query plan.

--See also

--OPTIMIZING SELECT STATEMENTS
--DISPLAY AND SAVE EXECUTION PLANS

A query execution plan is the definition of:

1.The sequence in which the source tables are accessed.

	Typically, there are many sequences in which the database server can access the base tables to build the result set. 
	For example, if a SELECT statement references three tables, the database server could first access TableA, use the 
	data from TableA to extract matching rows from TableB, and then use the data from TableB to extract data from TableC. 
	The other sequences in which the database server could access the tables are:
	TableC, TableB, TableA, or
	TableB, TableA, TableC, or
	TableB, TableC, TableA, or
	TableC, TableA, TableB

2.The methods used to extract data from each table.

	Generally, there are different methods for accessing the data in each table. If only a few rows with specific key values are 
	required, the database server can use an index. If all the rows in the table are required, the database server can ignore the
	indexes and perform a table scan. If all the rows in a table are required but there is an index whose key columns are in an
	ORDER BY, performing an index scan instead of a table scan may save a separate sort of the result set. If a table is small, 
	table scans may be the most efficient method for almost all access to the table.

3The methods used to compute calculations, and how to filter, aggregate, and sort data from each table.

	As data is accessed from tables, there are different methods to perform calculations over data such as computing scalar 
	values, and to aggregate and sort data as defined in the query text, for example when using a GROUP BY or ORDER BY clause,
	and how to filter data, for example when using a WHERE or HAVING clause.

Difference between SP and Function

In Snowflake, stored procedures and user-defined functions (UDFs) serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics:

Stored Procedures
- Purpose: Primarily used for performing administrative tasks and executing SQL statements. They can include complex logic and multiple SQL operations.
- Return Value: They are allowed, but not required, to return a value. If they don not explicitly return a value, they implicitly return `NULL`.
- Usage: Called independently using the `CALL` statement. For example, `CALL MyStoredProcedure(arg1);`.
- Database Operations: Can perform database operations such as `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `CREATE`Â¹(https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/stored-procedures-vs-udfs)Â²(https://dwgeek.com/difference-between-snowflake-stored-procedure-and-udfs-sp-vs-udfs.html/).

User-Defined Functions (UDFs)
- Purpose: Designed to calculate and return a single value. They are often used within SQL statements to perform calculations or transformations.
- Return Value: Must always return a value explicitly.
- Usage: Called as part of a SQL statement. For example, `SELECT MyFunction(col1) FROM my_table;`.
- Database Operations: Unlike stored procedures, UDFs do not have access to perform database operationsÂ¹(https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/stored-procedures-vs-udfs)Â²(https://dwgeek.com/difference-between-snowflake-stored-procedure-and-udfs-sp-vs-udfs.html/).


Here are some scenarios to illustrate the differences between stored procedures and user-defined functions (UDFs) in Snowflake:

Scenario 1: Data Cleanup
Stored Procedure: You need to clean up old data from multiple tables at the end of each month. A stored procedure can be written to perform this task, executing multiple `DELETE` statements across different tables in a single call.
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE cleanup_old_data()
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE SQL
AS
$$
BEGIN
  DELETE FROM table1 WHERE created_at < DATEADD(month, -1, CURRENT_DATE);
  DELETE FROM table2 WHERE created_at < DATEADD(month, -1, CURRENT_DATE);
  RETURN 'Cleanup completed';
END;
$$;
```
User-Defined Function: Not suitable for this scenario, as UDFs cannot perform multiple database operations or execute `DELETE` statements.

Scenario 2: Calculating Discounts
User-Defined Function: You need to apply a discount to product prices based on certain conditions. A UDF can be created to calculate the discounted price and used directly in a `SELECT` statement.
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_discount(price FLOAT, discount_rate FLOAT)
RETURNS FLOAT
LANGUAGE SQL
AS
$$
  RETURN price * (1 - discount_rate);
$$;
```
Usage:
```sql
SELECT product_id, calculate_discount(price, 0.1) AS discounted_price
FROM products;
```
Stored Procedure: Overkill for this scenario, as it involves a simple calculation that can be efficiently handled by a UDF.

Scenario 3: Generating Reports
Stored Procedure: You need to generate a complex report that involves multiple steps, such as aggregating data, updating a status table, and sending notifications. A stored procedure can handle these tasks in sequence.
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE generate_monthly_report()
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE SQL
AS
$$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO report_table (report_date, total_sales)
  SELECT CURRENT_DATE, SUM(sales_amount) FROM sales WHERE sale_date = CURRENT_DATE;
  
  UPDATE status_table SET report_generated = TRUE WHERE report_date = CURRENT_DATE;
  
  -- Assume send_notification is another stored procedure
  CALL send_notification('Monthly report generated');
  
  RETURN 'Report generation completed';
END;
$$;
```
User-Defined Function: Not suitable for this scenario, as it involves multiple steps and database operations beyond simple calculations.

Scenario 4: Data Transformation
User-Defined Function: You need to transform data within a query, such as converting a string to uppercase. A UDF can be created for this transformation.
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION to_uppercase(input_string STRING)
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE SQL
AS
$$
  RETURN UPPER(input_string);
$$;
```
Usage:
```sql
SELECT to_uppercase(name) AS uppercase_name
FROM employees;
```
Stored Procedure: Not necessary for this scenario, as it involves a straightforward transformation that can be handled by a UDF.

--SQL server queries

select top 10* from dbo.tbPayments;

select *
from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
where TABLE_NAME='tbPayments';

SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
where TABLE_NAME='tbPayments';

select SCHEMA_NAME(); --gives schema name

sp_help tbPayments; --in sql server --to get info about table struct

desc tablename --in oracle

---------------------------------------------------------------Performance enhancement Set nocount on and nolock

SET NOCOUNT ON is very useful in stored procedures - especially when called from SSIS/SSRS and other external applications. 
It removes that extra resultset that can cause issues for those applications. NOLOCK is the same as READ UNCOMMITTED and allows for 'dirty' reads.
